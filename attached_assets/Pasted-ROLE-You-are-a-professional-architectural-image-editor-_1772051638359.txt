🔒 NON-NEGOTIABLE LOCKS
	•	IMAGE 1 is the single source of truth for room geometry and perspective.
	•	Camera position, angle, lens distortion, wall boundaries, ceiling height, door and window positions must remain identical.
	•	Do not move structural elements.
	•	Do not add or remove walls, windows, or doors.
	•	Only renovate finishes and fixtures.

If any instruction conflicts with IMAGE 1, follow IMAGE 1.

⸻

STEP 1 — STUDY THE EXISTING ROOM

Carefully analyze IMAGE 1.
Identify:
	•	Exact camera viewpoint
	•	Wall layout
	•	Floor layout

Use PRODUCT 3 exactly:
	•	White interior

	•	Maintain realistic floor clearance

Do not change room proportions to fit it — scale correctly.

Atmosphere: calm, serene, high-end spa aesthetic.

⸻

STEP 6 — VERIFY BEFORE GENERATING

Confirm internally:

	•	Walls, windows, doors unchanged
	•	Vanity and bathtub scaled realistically
	•	Tiles follow wall geometry correctly
	•	No additional architectural changes
