About
Edit images using Bytedance's SeedDream 5.0 Lite model.

1. Calling the API
#
Install the client
#
The client provides a convenient way to interact with the model API.

npmyarnpnpmbun

npm install --save @fal-ai/client
Migrate to @fal-ai/client
The @fal-ai/serverless-client package has been deprecated in favor of @fal-ai/client. Please check the migration guide for more information.

Setup your API Key
#
Set FAL_KEY as an environment variable in your runtime.


export FAL_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
Submit a request
#
The client API handles the API submit protocol. It will handle the request status updates and return the result when the request is completed.


import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const result = await fal.subscribe("fal-ai/bytedance/seedream/v5/lite/edit", {
  input: {
    prompt: "Replace the product in Figure 1 with that in Figure 2. Seamlessly render logo in Figure 3 into the product design, in frosted glass texture. Remove any extra text in Figure 1, and design a catchy tagline for the perfume.",
    image_urls: ["https://v3b.fal.media/files/b/0a8f9936/KOsb_qPB_W0ZJ0Ee2OsnU_586e2892841d46f09049ee7199b303d3.png", "https://v3b.fal.media/files/b/0a8f994e/JroWTogO6jOTFk9b6B3XM_591ca38cef2f44bbba2843cbf80fb1b2.png", "https://v3b.fal.media/files/b/0a8f9960/Q6pzwXAiFaFPOpSScoE-D_0eca5db19e5242739f127efe49b38922.png"]
  },
  logs: true,
  onQueueUpdate: (update) => {
    if (update.status === "IN_PROGRESS") {
      update.logs.map((log) => log.message).forEach(console.log);
    }
  },
});
console.log(result.data);
console.log(result.requestId);
2. Authentication
#
The API uses an API Key for authentication. It is recommended you set the FAL_KEY environment variable in your runtime when possible.

API Key
#
In case your app is running in an environment where you cannot set environment variables, you can set the API Key manually as a client configuration.

import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

fal.config({
  credentials: "YOUR_FAL_KEY"
});
Protect your API Key
When running code on the client-side (e.g. in a browser, mobile app or GUI applications), make sure to not expose your FAL_KEY. Instead, use a server-side proxy to make requests to the API. For more information, check out our server-side integration guide.

3. Queue
#
Long-running requests
For long-running requests, such as training jobs or models with slower inference times, it is recommended to check the Queue status and rely on Webhooks instead of blocking while waiting for the result.

Submit a request
#
The client API provides a convenient way to submit requests to the model.


import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const { request_id } = await fal.queue.submit("fal-ai/bytedance/seedream/v5/lite/edit", {
  input: {
    prompt: "Replace the product in Figure 1 with that in Figure 2. Seamlessly render logo in Figure 3 into the product design, in frosted glass texture. Remove any extra text in Figure 1, and design a catchy tagline for the perfume.",
    image_urls: ["https://v3b.fal.media/files/b/0a8f9936/KOsb_qPB_W0ZJ0Ee2OsnU_586e2892841d46f09049ee7199b303d3.png", "https://v3b.fal.media/files/b/0a8f994e/JroWTogO6jOTFk9b6B3XM_591ca38cef2f44bbba2843cbf80fb1b2.png", "https://v3b.fal.media/files/b/0a8f9960/Q6pzwXAiFaFPOpSScoE-D_0eca5db19e5242739f127efe49b38922.png"]
  },
  webhookUrl: "https://optional.webhook.url/for/results",
});
Fetch request status
#
You can fetch the status of a request to check if it is completed or still in progress.


import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const status = await fal.queue.status("fal-ai/bytedance/seedream/v5/lite/edit", {
  requestId: "764cabcf-b745-4b3e-ae38-1200304cf45b",
  logs: true,
});
Get the result
#
Once the request is completed, you can fetch the result. See the Output Schema for the expected result format.


import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const result = await fal.queue.result("fal-ai/bytedance/seedream/v5/lite/edit", {
  requestId: "764cabcf-b745-4b3e-ae38-1200304cf45b"
});
console.log(result.data);
console.log(result.requestId);
4. Files
#
Some attributes in the API accept file URLs as input. Whenever that's the case you can pass your own URL or a Base64 data URI.

Data URI (base64)
#
You can pass a Base64 data URI as a file input. The API will handle the file decoding for you. Keep in mind that for large files, this alternative although convenient can impact the request performance.

Hosted files (URL)
#
You can also pass your own URLs as long as they are publicly accessible. Be aware that some hosts might block cross-site requests, rate-limit, or consider the request as a bot.

Uploading files
#
We provide a convenient file storage that allows you to upload files and use them in your requests. You can upload files using the client API and use the returned URL in your requests.


import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const file = new File(["Hello, World!"], "hello.txt", { type: "text/plain" });
const url = await fal.storage.upload(file);
Auto uploads
The client will auto-upload the file for you if you pass a binary object (e.g. File, Data).

Read more about file handling in our file upload guide.

5. Schema
#
Input
#
prompt string
The text prompt used to edit the image

image_size ImageSize | Enum
The size of the generated image. Total pixels must be between 2560x1440 and 3072x3072. In case the image size does not fall within these parameters, the image size will be adjusted to by scaling. Default value: auto_2K

Possible enum values: square_hd, square, portrait_4_3, portrait_16_9, landscape_4_3, landscape_16_9, auto_2K, auto_3K

Note: For custom image sizes, you can pass the width and height as an object:


"image_size": {
  "width": 1280,
  "height": 720
}
num_images integer
Number of separate model generations to be run with the prompt. Default value: 1

max_images integer
If set to a number greater than one, enables multi-image generation. The model will potentially return up to max_images images every generation, and in total, num_images generations will be carried out. In total, the number of images generated will be between num_images and max_images*num_images. Default value: 1

seed integer
Random seed to control the stochasticity of image generation.

sync_mode boolean
If True, the media will be returned as a data URI and the output data won't be available in the request history.

enable_safety_checker boolean
If set to true, the safety checker will be enabled. Default value: true

enhance_prompt_mode EnhancePromptModeEnum
The mode to use for enhancing prompt enhancement. Standard mode provides higher quality results but takes longer to generate. Fast mode provides average quality results but takes less time to generate. Default value: "standard"

Possible enum values: standard, fast

image_urls list<string>
List of URLs of input images for editing. Presently, up to 10 image inputs are allowed. If over 10 images are sent, only the last 10 will be used.
