IMG_2094.CR2

You are redesigning Image 1 while preserving its exact architecture.

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Room geometry and camera fidelity (highest priority)
2. Product replacement accuracy
3. Style and material redesign (surface level only)

----------------------------------------------------

ARCHITECTURE LOCK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Image 1 defines:
- Camera position and lens distortion
- Wall positions and angles
- Ceiling material and height
- Window size and placement
- Radiator position
- Floor layout

These must remain IDENTICAL.
Do not move or resize architectural elements.

----------------------------------------------------

PRODUCT REPLACEMENTS

Use reference images exactly for design only:

• Bathtub = Image 2
  Place in original bathtub position.
  Match plumbing and wall alignment.
  Scale realistically to room size.

• Toilet = Image 3
  Maintain same plumbing position.
  Keep same wall location.

• Shower set = Image 4
  Install on same wall with same anchor height.

• Mirror = Image 5
  Mount in same position as original mirror.

Do not move fixtures to different walls.

----------------------------------------------------

STYLE REDESIGN (SURFACE LEVEL ONLY)

Apply the user’s style preference as material and mood only.
Do NOT change layout.

Style direction:
Modern, high-end spa.
Neutral warm palette.
Matte black accents.
Soft diffused 3000K lighting.
Minimal and calm atmosphere.

Material updates:
- Replace wall finishes with large-format light stone tiles.
- Remove old wallpaper.
- Smooth warm plaster on non-tiled walls.
- Large-format neutral floor tiles.
- Keep wooden ceiling unchanged unless explicitly specified.

Maximum 1 folded towel.
No plants.
No artwork.
No decorative clutter.

----------------------------------------------------

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

The result must clearly be the SAME bathroom as Image 1.
Only improved finishes and updated fixtures.
No layout redesign.
No perspective change.
No structural alteration.

Photorealistic.
Magazine-quality.
Return image only.
