Option B: Single-Shot (Recommended)
Skip the empty room. One call to Pro with Thinking.

Inputs (images in this order):

Image 1:  Original bathroom photo (the current state)
Image 2:  Tile/material texture reference
Image 3:  Vanity reference photo
Image 4:  Toilet reference photo
Image 5:  Faucet reference photo  
Image 6:  Shower or bathtub reference photo
Image 7:  Lighting reference (if available)
Optional: Up to 3 inspiration/Pinterest images from step 1

The prompt — structured for Pro's Thinking mode:

Transform the bathroom in image 1 into a fully renovated 
bathroom. The reference photos (images 2-7) show the EXACT 
products to use — match their color, shape, material, and 
finish precisely.

{{#if hasInspirationImages}}
The inspiration images show the target aesthetic the customer 
wants to achieve.
{{/if}}

STEP 1 — STUDY THE EXISTING ROOM:
Analyze image 1 carefully. Note:
- The exact camera angle, height, and perspective
- The vanishing point and how walls recede
- Where the window(s) are and how light enters
- Where the door is
- The room proportions (which walls are longer, which shorter)
- Any architectural features (beams, niches, alcoves, 
  sloped ceiling)
ALL of these remain IDENTICAL in the final image.

STEP 2 — PLAN THE LAYOUT:
{{#if expertAnalysis}}
An expert has analyzed this specific room and advises:
Layout: {{expertAnalysis.layoutAdvice}}
Keep these elements: {{expertAnalysis.keepElements}}
Key opportunities: {{expertAnalysis.opportunities[0]}}
Complexity: {{expertAnalysis.estimated_complexity}}
Use this advice to guide placement decisions below.
{{/if}}
Based on the room shape and where the door/window are, 
determine the most logical position for each fixture. 
Plumbing typically connects on the wall where the existing 
fixtures are — keep new fixtures near those same walls when 
possible.

STEP 3 — APPLY MATERIALS:
Using the material from image 2:
- Floor: Apply as floor tiles across the entire floor. 
  Lay in a straight grid. Show grout lines that are subtle 
  but visible — the line spacing should match the tile 
  proportions in the reference photo. Lines converge 
  naturally toward the perspective vanishing point.
- Wet-area walls (shower zone, behind vanity): Same tile 
  material, running from floor to ceiling, continuous 
  without interruption.
- Dry walls: Smooth white or light-toned plaster finish.
{{#if hasWallPanels}}
  Alternatively for dry walls: seamless wall panels with 
  invisible joints for a modern, grout-free look.
{{/if}}

STEP 4 — PLACE EACH FIXTURE:
Install each product. Use the reference photos as EXACT 
visual guide — do not improvise the design.

VANITY (image 3): 
Mount against a wall with clear floor space in front of it. 
Standard height ~85cm. Frameless mirror centered above. The 
vanity should be proportionally correct for this room — not 
too large, not too small relative to the wall it sits against.

TOILET (image 4):
Wall-hung, against a wall perpendicular to the vanity wall 
if possible. Concealed cistern — the wall behind is flat 
with only a flush plate visible. Minimum 15cm clearance 
from the side wall.

FAUCET (image 5):
Installed on or above the vanity basin. If wall-mounted: 
protruding from the wall above the basin. Match the exact 
finish from the reference (chrome, matte black, brushed 
nickel, gold).

{{#if hasShower}}
SHOWER (image 6):
Walk-in with a frameless glass panel. Rain shower head 
mounted on the wall. Hand shower on a rail below it. 
Shower floor is flush with the room floor (no step up). 
Position near the window if one exists (natural light 
in the shower is desirable). 
{{/if}}
{{#if hasBathtub}}
BATHTUB (image 6):
Against the longest available wall. Faucet at the foot end. 
If freestanding: leave at least 15cm space around all sides.
{{/if}}

{{#if hasLighting}}
LIGHTING (image 7):
Mirror lighting above or beside the vanity mirror. Indirect 
ambient light elsewhere — warm tone, no harsh spots.
{{/if}}

STEP 5 — STYLE AND ATMOSPHERE:
Design style: {{styleSummary}}
{{#if stylePresetDescription}}
Style character: {{stylePresetDescription}}
{{/if}}

The overall feel should match these qualities: {{top8Tags}}

Lighting:
- Primary light: natural daylight from the existing 
  window(s), matching the original light direction
- Color temperature: warm (3000K atmosphere)
- Soft shadows from all fixtures onto adjacent surfaces
- No hard spotlight effects or overexposure

Finishing touches:
- 1-2 rolled or folded towels in neutral white or grey 
  on a towel rail or the vanity
- Realistic material textures: visible wood grain, stone 
  texture, metal sheen — no flat CG surfaces
- Chrome and glass show realistic reflections
- Grout lines are consistent in color and width throughout
- NOTHING else — no plants, candles, artwork, rugs, 
  bottles, or decorative objects

ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS:
- Room shape and proportions = IDENTICAL to image 1
- Camera angle and perspective = IDENTICAL to image 1
- Window positions, door positions = IDENTICAL to image 1
- Ceiling beams, niches, alcoves = IDENTICAL to image 1
- Do NOT add any windows or doors not present in image 1
- Do NOT add any objects not listed above
- Products must visually MATCH reference images 2-7 
  in color, shape, and finish

The final image should look like a professional interior 
photograph for a high-end design magazine — sharp, 
well-composed, inviting, and real.

What's Different From Your Current Prompt
Aspect	Your current prompt	New prompt
Input image	Empty shell (original photo already lost)	Original bathroom photo (model sees the real geometry)
Measurements	"{{width}}m breed × {{length}}m lang" (meaningless to the model)	Removed. Model analyzes proportions directly from the photo
Layout guidance	Generic rules ("langste vrije wand")	Fed from ExpertAnalysis when available — specific to THIS room
Product → image mapping	"{{vanityName}}" as text	"image 3" — explicitly tied to a numbered reference photo
Thinking guidance	None — one flat block of instructions	STEP 1-5 structure that matches how Pro's Thinking mode sequences its work
Step 1: Study the room	Missing entirely	Model is explicitly told to analyze perspective, vanishing point, and architectural features FIRST before any changes
Step 2: Plan layout	Missing	Model plans where things go BEFORE rendering — using ExpertAnalysis if available
Edit framing	"DOEL: Transformeer..." (generation framing)	"Transform the bathroom in image 1..." (edit framing — triggers structure preservation)
Negative constraints	Listed at the end	Repeated per step ("NOTHING else") AND at the end — redundancy is intentional for emphasis
Inspiration images	Not included	Passed as additional reference when available from step 1
keepElements from ExpertAnalysis	Not used	Fed into step 2 — model knows what to preserve from the original
The Biggest Single Improvement
Sending the original bathroom photo instead of the empty shell. Right now you're:

Taking the original photo
Destroying its geometry in the empty-room step
Asking the render step to maintain geometry it has never seen
With single-shot Pro, the model sees the original photo and reasons through the transformation internally. The Thinking mode's interim images are where it mentally "strips" the room. The final output transforms directly from the real photo — preserving the geometry it can actually see.
