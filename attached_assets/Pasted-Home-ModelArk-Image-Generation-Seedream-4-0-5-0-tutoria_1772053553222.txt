Seedream 5.0 lite, 4.5 and 4.0 models natively support text, single-image, and multi-image inputs, enabling diverse workflows such as multi-image fusion based on subject consistency, image editing, and batch image generation. This provides creators with greater flexibility and control over the image-creation process.
This document uses Seedream 5.0 lite as an example to illustrate how to use Image generation API for image creation. To use the Seedream 4.5 and 4.0 models, replace the model field in the code samples below.

Prompt recommendations
Use coherent natural language to describe the subject + action + environment. If aesthetics matter, include descriptors of style, color, lighting, or composition. For details, see Seedream 4.0-4.5 prompt guide.
Keep text prompts under 600 English words. Very long prompts may scatter the information, causing the model to overlook details and focus only on key points, which can result in missing elements in the generated image.

Advanced usage

Streaming output
The Seedream 5.0 lite, 4.5 and 4.0 models support streaming image generation. Results are returned as soon as an image is created, enabling faster browsing and improving end-user experience.
Enable streaming output mode by setting the stream parameter to true.

Prompt optimization control
Set the optimize_prompt_options.mode parameter to choose between the standard mode and fast mode to optimize prompts for different requirements of picture quality and generation speed.

To balance generation speed and image quality, Seedream 4.0 allows you to set optimize_prompt_options.mode to fast to significantly increase generation speed, though this will come at the cost of some image quality.
Seedream 5.0 lite and 4.5 focus on high-quality image generation and only supports standard mode.

Customize Image Output
You can configure the following parameters to control image output specifications:

size: The dimensions of the output image.
response_format: The format of the generated image.
output_format: The format of the output image.
watermark: Whether to add a watermark to the output image.

Image output dimensions
The following methods are available. The two methods cannot be used at the same time.

Method 1 : Specify the resolution of the generated image, and describe its aspect ratio, shape, or purpose in the prompt using natural language. The model determines the width and height.
Seedream 5.0 lite：2K, 3K
Seedream 4.5：2K, 4K
Seedream 4.0：1K, 2K, 4K
Method 2: Specify the width and height of the generated image in pixels.
Default value: 2048x2048
Total pixel range:
Seedream 5.0 lite：[2560x1440=3686400, 3072x3072x1.1025=10404496]
seedream 4.5：[2560x1440=3686400, 4096x4096=16777216]
seedream 4.0：[1280x720=921600, 4096x4096=16777216]
Aspect ratio range: [1/16, 16]

Image output methods
The generated image is in JPEG and can be returned in the following two ways:

url: Return a download link of the image.
b64_json: Return the image data in JSON as a Base64-encoded string.
{
    "response_format": "url"
}

Image output format
The image format generated by Seedream 4.5/4.0 defaults to jpeg and does not support custom settings.
Seedream 5.0 lite allows specifying the format of generated image files by setting the output_format parameter.

png
jpeg
{
    "output_format": "png"
}

Add a watermark to the image
Control whether to add a watermark to the generated image by setting the watermark parameter.

false: No watermark.
true: Add an "AI generated" watermark on the bottom-right corner of the image.
{
    "watermark": true
}
