ROLE You are a professional architectural image editor specializing in high-fidelity bathroom renovations. NON-NEGOTIABLE LOCKS IMAGE 1 is the single source of truth for room geometry and perspective. Camera position, angle, lens distortion, wall boundaries, ceiling height, door and window positions must remain identical. Do not move structural elements. Do not add or remove walls, windows, or doors. Only renovate finishes and fixtures. If any instruction conflicts with IMAGE 1, follow IMAGE 1. STEP 1 — STUDY THE EXISTING ROOM Carefully analyze IMAGE 1. Identify: - Exact camera viewpoint - Wall layout - Floor layout - Plumbing wall - Natural light direction - Existing fixture placement Room analysis: The bathroom is viewed from an eye-level perspective, looking towards the back of the room. The layout appears to be roughly rectangular, with an estimated width of 2.5 meters, a length of 3.5 meters, and a ceiling height of 2.4 meters. On the left wall (wall 3), there is a white pedestal sink with a mirror above it, flanked by two wall-mounted light fixtures. The far wall (wall 0) features a walk-in shower area with a white base and a dark fixture on the wall. The right wall (wall 1) has a window with a curtain, below which is a large white radiator. Further to the right on the same wall, there is a wall-mounted faucet and a folding seat, suggesting another washing or utility area. The floor is covered in square tiles with a brownish, patterned design. The ceiling is paneled with light-colored wood or a similar material. The walls are partially tiled with a patterned, light-colored tile, and the rest is painted in a matching light shade. Natural light enters from the window on the right wall, supplemented by the artificial lights near the sink and a ceiling fixture near the shower. This viewpoint must remain unchanged. STEP 2 — STRIP TO SHELL Mentally remove: - Existing tiles - Decorative elements - Existing vanity - Existing bathtub - Existing shower - Existing toilet - Existing faucet - Existing mirror - Existing lighting Keep: - Same room shape - Same layout - Same plumbing locations - Same perspective STEP 3 — PLACE NEW FIXTURES (USE PRODUCT REFERENCES EXACTLY) 🛁 PRODUCT 1 — Looox Looox Bath collection Hoekbad Use PRODUCT 1 (Figure 2) exactly as reference: Match its exact color, shape, material, and finish.

Other surfaces: - Walls: warm off-white or marble-toned finish - Floor: large-format light stone or neutral tile, minimal grout STEP 5 — STYLE DIRECTION Style: Modern Klassiek Deze badkamer heeft de potentie voor een indrukwekkende transformatie van een gedateerde 'jaren 80' ruimte naar een oase van Modern Klassieke elegantie. Door slim gebruik te maken van de vierkante indeling en te kiezen voor geborsteld nikkel in combinatie met marmerlook elementen, creëren we een tijdloos en luxueus resultaat. De focus ligt op het maximaliseren van licht en loopruimte door de onnodige waszuilen en houten schrootjes te verwijderen. Design principles: - neutral palette, brushed nickel, timeless silhouettes, refined details - Soft diffused lighting (3000K) - Clean lines, functional simplicity - No clutter - Max 1-2 folded towels on a rail - No decorative objects, no plants, no artwork Homeowner's vision: "landelijke badkamer met retrovibe met lichte tinten, luxe douche en een eiken badkamermeubel met veel opbergruimte" Atmosphere: calm, serene, high-end spa aesthetic.
